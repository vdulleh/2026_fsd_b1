    <h1>Beyond Generative: The Rise Of Agentic AI And User-Centric Design</h1>
    <h2>Developing effective agentic AI requires a new research playbook. When systems plan, decide, and act on our behalf, UX moves beyond usability testing into the realm of trust, consent, and accountability. Victor Yocco outlines the research methods needed to design agentic AI systems responsibly
    <p>At this level, design and oversight should prioritize clear, non-intrusive notifications and a well-defined process for users to act on suggestions. The focus is on empowering the user with timely and relevant information without taking control. UX practitioners should focus on making suggestions clear and easy to understand, while product managers need to ensure the system provides value without overwhelming the user.</p>

    <h3>Observe-and-Suggest</h3>
    <p>At this level, design and oversight should prioritize clear, non-intrusive notifications and a well-defined process for users to act on suggestions. The focus is on empowering the user with timely and relevant information without taking control. UX practitioners should focus on making suggestions clear and easy to understand, while product managers need to ensure the system provides value without overwhelming the user.</p>
    <p>It’s easy to confuse Agentic AI with Robotic Process Automation (RPA), which is technology that focuses on rules-based tasks performed on computers. The distinction lies in rigidity versus reasoning. RPA is excellent at following a strict script: if X happens, do Y. It mimics human hands. Agentic AI mimics human reasoning. It does not follow a linear script; it creates one. It can plan, make decisions, and take actions on behalf of users. It’s the difference between a self-driving car that follows pre-set routes and one that navigates complex traffic situations autonomously.</p>
    <h3>A Simple Taxonomy of Agentic Behaviors</h3>
    
<p> We can categorize agent behavior into four distinct modes of autonomy. While these often look like a progression, they function as independent operating modes. A user might trust an agent to act autonomously for scheduling, but keep it in “suggestion mode” for financial transactions.</p>
